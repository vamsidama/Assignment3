# Matplotlib Visualization Assignment â€“ ICP3_B

This project contains practice exercises on **data visualization using Matplotlib** in Python. The tasks are designed to help understand both functional and object-oriented (OO) approaches for plotting.

##  Objective

To get hands-on experience with:
- Basic line plotting using `plt.plot()`
- Creating subplots with `plt.subplots()`
- Customizing plots with labels, titles, and styles
- Using object-oriented methods for advanced layout control

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas (optional use)

## Features Covered

- Plotting static lists and paired values
- Multiple plot formats
- Figure and Axes object manipulation
- Plot customization (color, style, gridlines)

## Files

- `ICP3_B.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all visualizations and code.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `ICP3_B.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode
3. Run the cells to see the plots in action

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
